## Hi there, I'm Robert PorÄ™ba ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack developer from Poland who likes to work with JavaScript/Typescript (React, React Native, Node), C# (.NET).

I'm highly involved in my work and self-development. Since I was a kid, computer science has been my passion, that's why I graduated BE in university and I'm pursuing to graduate MSng in computer science. I worked in a few different programming fields, which let me know web development is most interesting for me and I want to do this in my life. Currently, I'm focused on the .NET and Node platform as an application back-end and React, React Native as a front-end. Working with ambitious people who, like me, love programing is for me most important.
